# MyBinarySearchTree
This task implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in Java. The BST class allows for key-value pairs to be stored in the tree, with operations such as _insertion_,_deletion_, and _iteration_ over the keys.

# How to Run
-Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:
> git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyBinarySearchTree

-Compile the TestBST.java file using a Java compiler:
> javac TestBST.java

-Run the compiled Java program:
> java TestBST

-The program will create an instance of MyBinarySearchTree and perform operations on it

# Size
The **iterator()** method now implements in-order traversal to iterate over the keys in ascending order

# Traversing the Tree
The BST now include iterator() method = implements in-order traversal to iterate over the keys in ascending order.You can use the enhanced for loop to access both the key and value of each node during iteration
